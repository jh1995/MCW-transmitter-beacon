# MCW-transmitter-beacon

This is an extremely simple Modulated Light Beacon and Transmitter (MCW).

On Arduino pin 10 you get a beacon signal with custom string and three-tone sequence.
On Arduino pin 11 you get a continous tone that can be interrupted with a CW key.

Pin definitions and tone frequencies can be changed in #define's.
